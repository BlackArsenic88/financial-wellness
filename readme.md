# Financial Wellness Machine Learning Algorithm 💰
This algorithm empowers individuals, families, and organizations to make smarter financial decisions by leveraging AI automation to:
- Reduce Risks: Anticipate financial stress signals like underinsurance, high debt-to-income, or inconsistent cash flow.
- Make Money: Provide actionable insights for income optimization, budget efficiency, and investment readiness.
- Create Heirlooms: Promote intergenerational wealth management through predictive Web3 models that identify long-term value behaviors (e.g., savings, investing, gifting, and legacy planning).
